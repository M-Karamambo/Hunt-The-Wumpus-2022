He died of severe lacerations and head wounds from what appears to be a large mammal that was being tested inside the Lewellen Labs. No team members have offered any explanation for how or what caused Julian's death and simply remark that they offer sincere condolences to his family. Other team member, Cadence Ching, was also found dead due to severe wounds. Her body was discovered in the woods 40 feet from the lab missing an arm and coverved in severe flesh wounds. Her body appeared to be dragged, and the area is currently under heavy surveillance. Please report any strange lifeforms or activities you see nearby.");
